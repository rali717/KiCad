KiCad
=====

At work the firewall blocked the loading of the schematic lib files.
So I delete in KiCad all the global links to the KiCad Lib repository.
Copied the Lib-File-Snapshot to local and add these as additional lib to my local project.
Now I can work offline. 
The actual snapshot of the schematic lib files is from 12th of December 2014.
